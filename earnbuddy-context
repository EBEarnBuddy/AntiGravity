The platform is based on collaboration, where there are existing startup opportunities, freelance projects that are handled with colancing or teamlancing, events, and circles.

In the circles section (simply put, chatrooms for various purposes), we have three types of circles, opportunity circles, community circles, and event circles. Opportunity circles are private cricles that the system generates whenever an opportunity (startup roles or project posting) is posted, anyone who applied to this particular opportunity, and got accepted, shall be added to this room, where the team shall proceed with their respective tasks. the community circles are the public cricles, where interaction, PR and engagement on the platform occurs, these circles are the ones capable of creating events. two or more community circles can collaborate to create an event, one circle simply has to send a collab request to another circle with a proposal, and the request when accepted, creates an event. Event circles are temporary circles that have a fixed tenure, and are attached to a particular event with which they are created automatically. these contain all the members from both the community circles.

In the events section, the user sees various events in which he or she may take part in. various events created by different circles shall be displayed here.

In the startups section, one can post various roles available for his/her startup, along with available startup opportunities. when u post an opportunity, an opportunity circle is created, u accepted an reject the application on the opportunity, and those accepted, rejected etc are notified, accepted ones are added directly to the opp. circle.

nearly same as startup section for freelancing, but for freelance projects below. (think and mention how these two could be differenciated)

there shall also be a home page, that acts like a dashboard, displaying all the stats and statuses of the current user activity, for example, your current applications and their statuses, updates in your rooms etc. (think and mention in detail what else could be added to the homepage for example, suggestions, etc.)

I want a detailed writing, regarding every feature broken down to the specifics.

Below is a ~1000-word, well-structured, deeply detailed documentation describing the internal workflow, user experience, and system logic of EarnBuddy based on all the information you’ve shared across conversations.

EarnBuddy — Platform Workflow & Functional Documentation (1000 Words)
EarnBuddy is a collaboration-first ecosystem designed to unify startup roles, freelance projects, community interaction, and event collaboration into a single structured workflow. The core philosophy is simple: opportunities bring people together, community creates energy, and collaboration makes execution possible. EarnBuddy operationalizes this through four main pillars: Startups, Freelancing, Communities (Circles), and Events, supported by a personalized Home Dashboard.

1. Circles: The Collaboration Engine
Circles form the backbone of EarnBuddy. Every interaction—whether joining a team, participating in an event, or engaging with a community—happens inside a Circle. There are three types:

1.1 Opportunity Circles (Private, System-Generated)
These circles are created automatically whenever a user or startup posts an opportunity—either a startup role or a freelancing/colancing project.

Workflow
Opportunity Posted

A Startup founder posts a role (e.g., “Frontend Engineer Intern”).

A Freelancer posts a project requiring contributors under Colancing.

Circle Auto-Creation

The system generates a private Opportunity Circle tied uniquely to the posting.

Application Management

Interested users apply.

The opportunity owner sees all applicants with profile insights (skills, past work, badges, experience).

They can accept, reject, or shortlist candidates.

Actions trigger notifications to applicants.

Circle Membership

All accepted contributors are automatically added to the Opportunity Circle.

Rejected candidates receive status updates (but not access to the circle).

The opportunity owner becomes the “Circle Lead.”

Inside the Opportunity Circle

Task Board (kanban-style or chat-based task assignments).

Real-time chat & file sharing.

Assigned roles and sub-tasks.

Activity logs & progress indicators.

Milestones defined by the startup/project owner.

Opportunity Circles persist for as long as the role/project remains active.

1.2 Community Circles (Public, User-Facing)
Community Circles are public chatrooms built around themes, interests, industries, or regions—e.g., AI Circle, Indie Hackers, Web3 India, Startup Builders, Design Pod, etc.

Role in the Platform
Serve as hubs for PR, networking, discussion, and discoverability.

System recommends Circles based on user interests, skills, and past activity.

Leaders (circle admins) can pin resources, create mini-initiatives, and organize sessions.

Event Creation Ability
Community Circles can create events, but only through collaboration:

Circle A sends a Collab Request to Circle B.

The request includes:

Event concept

Roles needed (speaker, moderator, volunteers)

Target audience

Circle B accepts → Event is created.

This mechanism reinforces EarnBuddy’s core idea: collaboration drives creation.

1.3 Event Circles (Temporary, Auto-Managed)
Event Circles are generated automatically when two community circles collaborate to create an event.

Characteristics
Include members of both community circles.

Have a predefined tenure (from event creation → event completion).

Dissolve or archive after event completion.

Used for:

coordination of event logistics,

sharing event materials (presentations, schedules, posters),

real-time announcements,

volunteer onboarding.

Event Circles unify communities for short-term collaboration.

2. Events Section
The Events page is the “explore board” for everything happening across EarnBuddy communities.

Key Features
Upcoming Events: Workshops, hackathons, pitch nights, founder AMA sessions.

Events by Circles: Filter by communities you belong to.

Your Registered Events: badges, deadlines, and event reminders.

Collaborated Events: Multi-circle events show joint hosting communities.

Each event entry shows:

Date & time

Hosting Circles

Expected audience

Participation type (open, invite-only, mentorship required, etc.)

Event Circle link (once registered)

3. Startups Section
This section is dedicated to founders posting roles or finding collaborators for their ventures.

3.1 Posting Startup Roles
Founders can post:

Full-time roles

Internship roles

Co-founder searches

Equity-based collaboration opportunities

What Happens in System
The moment the role is posted, an Opportunity Circle is created.

Applicants join the opportunity pool.

The founder manages applicants via:

skill match score,

portfolio,

interview scheduling.

Accepted users are added to the circle where work begins.

Differentiator from Freelancing
Startup roles may involve long-term collaboration, equity, or ongoing responsibilities.

Team behaviour resembles building a company.

4. Freelancing (Colancing and Teamlancing)
Freelancing projects follow the same pipeline as Startup opportunities but differ in execution philosophy.

Differences from Startups
Aspect	Freelancing	Startups
Duration	Short-term gigs	Long-term roles
Payment	Fixed/Hourly	Salary/Equity/Co-founder
Execution Style	Colancing (shared workload)	Team leadership & high commitment
Circle Focus	Task fulfillment	Company building
Colancing / Teamlancing
Instead of hiring one freelancer, the project owner can onboard multiple specialized contributors into a single Opportunity Circle.
Examples:

A branding project → logo designer + copywriter + motion graphics artist.

A SaaS landing page → frontend dev + illustrator + UX writer.

EarnBuddy standardizes team-based freelancing.

5. Home Dashboard (Central Activity Hub)
The Home Dashboard provides a personalized overview of everything happening across the user’s EarnBuddy universe.

Components (Detailed)
5.1 Application Statuses
Shows:

Circle invitations

Circle activity pings

Event reminders

Collaboration requests

Task assignments

Notifications are grouped by type for clarity.

7. User Profiles
Each profile includes:

Skills and endorsements

Previous circle participation

Profiles help opportunity owners pick the right team quickly.

8. How All Systems Work Together (E2E Flow)
User joins EarnBuddy → explores Circles.

Applies to a startup role or freelance gig.

If accepted, joins an Opportunity Circle.

Parallelly engages in Community Circles for PR and networking.

Community Circles collaborate → create Events.

User participates in events, gains reputation, and attracts more opportunities.

EarnBuddy becomes a collaboration flywheel where each action increases the probability of growth for users, teams, and communities.

Final Summary
EarnBuddy combines:

Opportunity discovery,

Community-driven events,

Team-based execution, and

Transparent collaboration management

into one cohesive ecosystem powered by Circles.
